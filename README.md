# About

This repository contains code that corresponds with the paper "Assessing Distance Metrics for Change Point Detection in Continual Learning Scenarios." The link to access the paper will be put here once the paper is published. 

Our approach generalized WATCH, which is accessible at https://github.com/lifelonglab/watch and was used in trials using the Wasserstein distance metric. 

Some datasets used in the paper can be accessed at https://github.com/lifelonglab/lifelong-anomaly-detection-scenarios/tree/main 

The code used to run the change point detection experiments is in the `cpd_distance_trials.py` file. Experimental results beyond those presented the paper can be found the files `experimental_results.csv` and `CPD_Full_Tables.pdf`. The former contains information on the hyperparameters and results, and the latter contains cleaned tables of cover and F1 scores associated with the distance metrics in each trial.
